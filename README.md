# code


The folder named "Java" contains the .java files I was responsible for as part of a group project in 2019. The application we made automated sales of uniforms at my
school. My part of the project was creating the connection between the app and the database, as well as the View Controller for one of the pages.

The folder named "Python" contains a Python program that uses Google Tensorflow to recognize hand-written digits that I made in the Summer of 2020.

In the "Swift" folder, are the .swift files from my first project. In the Summer of 2017, I made an iOS app with Xcode that could encrypt and decrypt text messages.
